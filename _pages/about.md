I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/), advised by Prof. [Jiafeng Guo](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~gjf/). I also work with [Yixing Fan](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~fanyixing/) and [Ruqing Zhang](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~zhangruqing/). My research interests are in leveraging pre-trained language models to understand and enhance information retrieval (IR), including but not limited to **understanding relevance in IR**, **pre-training for IR**, **training dense retrieval models**, **designing efficient ranking framework** and etc.

### Highlight: [A curated list of awesome papers related to pre-trained models for information retrieval](https://github.com/Albert-Ma/awesome-pretrained-models-for-information-retrieval)

### News
- [Jan. 2021] Our PROP model reached the top of the MSMARCO Document Ranking leaderboard.
