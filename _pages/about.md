I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/), advised by Prof. [Jiafeng Guo](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~gjf/). I also work with [Yixing Fan](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~fanyixing/) and [Ruqing Zhang](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~zhangruqing/). 
My research is focused on the core problem in information retrieval (IR): **ranking**.
Specifically, my current research interests are in leveraging pre-trained language models into IR, including but not limited to **understanding the relevance in IR**, **pre-training for IR** and **dense retrieval**.

### <span style="color:#2561a0">Highlight</span>
- A survey of Pre-training for IR: [Pre-training Methods in Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13853)
