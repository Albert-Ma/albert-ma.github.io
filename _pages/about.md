I am now a senior software engineer / researcher at Baidu Search. 
My work at Baidu includes research and development on ranking models powering Baidu's core search engine and now focusing on developing the next-generation search product based on large language models.

Prior to joining Baidu, I earned my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Jiafeng Guo](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~gjf/) in 2023. 
Additionally, I received the B.E. degree from Shandong university in 2017.

I have broad research interests in information retrieval and natural language processing, with a particular emphasis on harnessing the capabilities of large language models to revolutionize the way we access, understand, and utilize information.
